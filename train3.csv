Stupid question, but is Novak his real first name?;Annoyance
He was granted exceptional visa. Until it was made political.;Anger
Hes like a pokemon and evolving Novak > Novax > Novisa;Humour
He dropped it at that time to be discussed at the pub.;Humour
"It is wholely un-Australian that there isn't a ""Shit Cunt Clause"" in the Immigration Act (or whatever legislation applies to these visas).";Humour
Good. F that egomaniacal socoipath;Humour
Good luck appealing this in the Federal Court, it is almost unprecedented in Australia for a federal judge to order the executive government to grant someone a visa.;Joy
Good.  Cya later.;Joy
Good, it's about time !;Joy
Good. Fuck him and his entitled ass. Hope the door does hit him on the way out.;Joy
Good riddance.;Joy

Can he appeal this?;Annoyance
Hope at least some of this has been captured on Nothing to Declare;Humour
Hey!! Look at that, a glimmer of brightness in this world;Joy
Haha, what an idiot;Joy
Oh please this is entirely a political decision by the tyrannical Morrison govt to cover up failed covid policies;Annoyance
Woop Woop great news. I hope he isn't allowed into the UK this summer;Joy
He's richer than all of us here, so who cares;Annoyance
He Lied about his travel before arriving, he was unvaccinated, he Lied on his forms, Admitted to falsifying a covid test and Breached His Visa. He deserves it;Anger
I see a lot of envious comments.  Your fangs are showing!  ü§£ü§£ü§£;Annoyance
"Excellent decision, he lied and now he pays the consequences of his actions. 
I'd say all world's governments should pay more attentions at people with covid related documents made in Serbia, clearly there are some issues.";Joy
He was acting super shady and dishonest with the Aussie authorities. They did the right thing.;Joy
Best news ever !!;Joy
This is ridiculous. Serbia should recall their ambassadors to Australia and expel Australia‚Äôs ambassadors to them. Screw this Australian power trip;Anger
On behalf of much of the world... Thanks Australia!!;Joy
As an Australian, I am embarrassed and ashamed of my Government‚Ä¶;Anger

Looking from the outside we have a completely healthy Djokovic that is not ill and continuously tested, while an Australian Tennis champ is practicing and still on the list to take part while having a positive PCR;Uneasiness
I'll give a thumbs up to that;Joy
Been down under. Their customs and quarantine blokes (and sheilas) are pretty serious bunch pre-Djokovic and pre-pandemic!! This is not surprising folks üòéüí™üèºüëçüèº;Joy
Good. Being good at tennis doesn‚Äôt exempt you from the rules. Especially when you openly shit on the rules.;Joy
Nikola Jokavic is the best NBA center why would they deport him;Annoyance
This man is the poster child for all HCA recipients. He needs to be deported to show the rules apply to all, regardless of personal choice.;Joy

Australian people are really still scared of Covid?;Annoyance
Dura lex sed lex;Suspense
Well done to the border and immigration staff.;Joy
Would be good if pauline hanson kicked him out;Humour
Seeing that the alternative for lying on your custom documents is jail time,  this really is the better outcome for him.;Joy
‚ÄúWe need to divert public attention away from Hillsong and their free RAT‚Äôs‚Äù;Anger

Now Mr Medvedev, please win and shove 2000 points up his pretentious ass, thank you.;Joy
Australians (not me) have the best phrase - ‚Äòget over yourself!‚Äô;Joy
Good luck Rafa! You can do this!;Awe
"Although I think that Djoko is a stupid anti-science dude, Those covid-rules to enter a country are bullshit, and it should just be cancelled for everyone.
Because of rules like that, even though I'm fully vaccinated, I can't reenter my country because they fear for this variant (for how long), maybe when I'll be able to go back to my home country my grandparents will already be dead so I won't have anyone to protect from covid anyway lol, fuck this";Anger
Guess he should've taken lessons from Aaron Rodgers.;Suspense
Tenis federation should remove the Grand Slam out of the australian clown covid-dictatorship for arbitrary totalitarian measures.;Anger
His family turned out to just as big of a cunt as he is, this is awesome news!;Joy

Tiebreaking news!;Annoyance
Hope Djokovic enjoys playing on the Federal Court - later tater;Annoyance
Good old reddit, pick your response from one the pre-approved opinions. Otherwise downvoted into oblvivion.;Anger
Do Nadal next.;Annoyance
Don‚Äôt be too complimentary towards the Australian government over this. Although it may have been the right decision, make no mistake that this whole affair has been managed by the Morrison government to direct attention away from its inability to manage the domestic covid situation. It‚Äôs no coincidence that the decision was made just before the weekend to try and control the weekend media cycle.;Uneasiness
If you are an Australian living in Serbia, be very very careful!!!!;Anger
"Just to remind everyone, ""the Morrison government"" is still a piece of shit backwards government who doesn't represent this country with any care of its inhabitants at all.";Uneasiness
Too bad NoVax! Next year you will win it again;Annoyance

At least he won‚Äôt have to listen to that god awful accent anymore;Annoyance
A spider caught in his own web of lies and deceit. Karma.;Joy

Corona fascism;Anger
GET HES FUCKING ASS OUT ALREADY....dude is obviously a dickhead lier;Joy
Ha and also, ha;Humour
anti vaxxers = selfish;Joy
I'm fully convinced he heard about the no-vax movement, misunderstood it as Novak's movement and thought he found his calling, no matter what they represent.;Humour
Does this mean there will be a war between Australia and Serbia?;Anger
I just discovered that Hawke is my MP. I have never voted for him before but I might even offer to hand out how to vote cards for him this year! Legend!;Vitality
Does the man have covid?;Annoyance
The kind of asshole that double parks on disabled bays.  The exact same behaviour.;Anger
Never been to Australia, but in this whole situation they just come out as weak;Anger
Well I guess that the system sometimes works.;Joy
My personal feeling is that Djokovic should never have been allowed into Australia. He had no legitimate reason not to be vaccinated, he lied on his visa application, and if not lying about his 2nd Covid diagnosis he deliberately exposed others to Covid by refusing to isolate. He frankly sounds like a scumbag.;Joy
But the Federal Circuit Court will have emergency hearing from 8:45pm tonight. Talking about special treatments......;Anger
"Stop making this a ""tennis player"" thing. He is a human and needs to adhere to the rules and regulations like everyone else. He acts like a kid in Publix throwing a hissy fit.";Joy

"Excellent. Satisfying as it would be to see him continually boo'ed on court, it'll be more satisfying to see him deported with Australia's collective boot up his arse. I'm picturing the plane door being slammed and someone saying ""And STAY out!""";Joy
First player to be deported after double-faulting.;Annoyance
Serves him right, it's not because you're a great tennis player that you can just ignore the law.;Joy
Finally.  He is such a great example of what entitlement does to people. Imo he should be stripped of his wins, and never allowed to compete again..;Joy
Novak has diplomatic passport, they can‚Äôt deport him.;Anger
I read that he can apeal this decision and get a transitional visa while waiting and so he will still  be able to play the match.;Anger
This has been a wilder ride than all of 2021;Vitality
Even if he did get in to play, can you imagine the crowd when he eventually comes on court? Doubt the referee would be able to control them all.;Joy
Must be great to live in a country border controls. Here in UK even migrants that have committed the most serious crimes are at very low risk of deportation.;Anger
Good call. Dude knowingly left isolation and managed to put innocent lives in danger for no reason. He clearly has no regard for anyone other than himself and it's good news he's being cancelled for it.;Anger

well well well, if it isn't the consequences of my actions;Joy
Poor fucking baby is concerned about being able to play tennis but doesn‚Äôt give a damn about protecting others from Covid! I‚Äôm glad they are trying to deny entry to his righteous ass and hope they kick him out of the country!;Joy
I'm sure he's really broken about this as he lives comfortably the rest of his life with his hundreds of millions of dollars in the bank.;Anger
Not gonna lie, waking up and reading this post made me smile. Good riddance!;Joy
He fucking lied multiple times. Quit defending this asshats actions. If you pulled this shit you would be in jail.;Joy
Go home antivaxer!;Joy
already played his last game at Australian open;Humour
Good. This guy is such a piece of shit.;Joy
Pretty sure this is only so hype in the media because it's a great cover up story for our real immigration crisis. Sending asylum seekers to private prisons owned by western companies, set up in third world countries in horrible conditions.;Uneasiness
Get fucked Novax;Joy
I think it's the right decision. Especially with everything else coming out about him and what he's done recently.;Joy

I‚Äôm probably so late to this but nowhere does it say he‚Äôs being deported. He has another interview tomorrow and his lawyers will be fighting that decision?;Suspense
Australia isn't free... only a bunch of goats there. Otherwise they would react to this insane things;Anger
Tennis these days is such a RACKET.;Annoyance
Djoko's hack political lawyers are making spurious arguments rather than letting this go. His tests are phony and he lied. Time to go the fuck back to Serbia.;Anger
He needs to deported the same way anyone else would;Joy
Good, it‚Äôs what the smug cunt deserves;Joy
Good. Suck it you arrogant cunt.;Joy
"When does he become airborne? He deserves a great sendoff at the airport. Millions of tennis fans singing ""Hit the road jack and don't you come back no more no more no more no more hit the road jack and don't you come back no more."" Or an equivalent!";Joy
If it is on health and public interest grounds, wouldn't he have already spread his covid around Aus by now? Or are they thinking he plans to get infected at the AO and only then spread it.;Annoyance
Good riddance!;Joy
Most of the people here seem to support strict visa entry requirements for countries, and yet somehow also support mass illegal immigration at the same time.;Anger

No. He LIED and got exemption which was revoked. Don‚Äôt be stupid.;Joy
Hooray;Joy
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ what a prick;Joy

"Even Donald Trump says you're ""Gutless"", if you don't say whether you've had a booster or not.";Annoyance
He has not even been taken back to detention after having his visa cancelled which is mandatory per the law. More preferential treatment for an entitled dick, who is so tone deaf he doesn‚Äôt realise what a slap in the face this is to all those who had to abide by the rules.;Anger

Why did he lie about testing positive for Covid? I just don't understand that;Anger
All of this just because he wouldn‚Äôt get a prick in the arm, why do people make it so hard on themselves?;Anger
Too right the poor aussies are under hardcore rules and he can flounder them because he‚Äôs good at batting balls? Piss off;Anger
Rules should apply to everyone;Annoyance
You‚Äôre fired bud;Annoyance
See? Closed borders DO work;Joy
Hell yeah!;Joy
If Serbia is in the EU - he may travel freely depending on each country‚Äôs health laws - this  covid- 19 virus is a serious issue - The tennis player is not above the law - he should respect Australia‚Äôs public health rules - and not insult them with his intransigence against vaccines- I‚Äôm sure he got the smallpox vaccine when a baby.;Anger
If he were a American he‚Äôd be crying about his ‚Äúrights!‚Äù;Annoyance
Ok... So basically am not a fan of Novak s character. But he is a great tennis player. But I also think he fakes genuinity in front of people. This time he did think he is above all. It doesn't matter if he was unvaccinated and got covid and so the natural immunity. Everyone has the right to choose. But end of the day we have to obey the respective country's rules without making 'human error' excuses multiple times. If it was anyone else, they wouldn't even have a chance and would be put on a black list by the immigration.;Anger
It's so sad that this is on top of world news. This is what our civilization is all about. Entertainment and capitalism.;Annoyance

Well well well, if it isn't the consequences to my  actions...;Joy
I love Australia, great job!;Joy
What I find frustrating is he‚Äôs only getting his VISA denied because people forced the issue, the Aussie government had allowed him in under a bullshit exemption because he make the yellow balls go zoom good;Annoyance
Hey, I've seen this one before;Suspense
Wow. Fuck this guy.;Joy
You can be both the GOAT and an asshole;Joy
I hope this means we get a second song from Tom Cardy.;Vitality

Everyone should obey the visiting countries‚Äô law! We the ‚Äònormal people‚Äô have to obey it, so to me it‚Äôs normal that someone with money, power, tennis skills has the same right as me.;Joy
Redditors are lost..;Suspense
Of all the news in the world,  why is this guy on top of all my news feeds every day?  Who cares?;Annoyance

This is really fantastic news. Thankyou Australia for upholding a morally correct view üôè;Vitality
Novax Covidovic;Annoyance
Good. The rules don't apply differently just because you're a rich, self-entitled tennis superstar. Not enough for an exemption.;Joy
Good. Bye üëãüèª;Joy
When will all the news about this no-vac Novak stop? I mean he is everywhere and I don't even care about him. How about just send him home like they would have already done with anybody else?;Annoyance
China for the Win;Anger
"IF he lied then that should be the reason, lf it is in the ""public interest"" then that will be the grounds for appeal. They are setting this up to let him in.";Annoyance
About time he was sent home. Can't have one rule for the rich one for the poor;Joy
You can say all about this guy, judge this guy, hate this guy, but at the end of the day he is 1000000000x times more successful than you. The guy is set for life, he can do whatever he wants. You cannot because you are poor. If he doesn‚Äôt want the vaccine he doesn‚Äôt get the vaccine and he can pay whatever fine the punishment is. So looking at him from average Redditors point of view - scared, frustrated and with a shit ton of problems, it‚Äôs good to just judge others so that we don‚Äôt need to look at ourselves. How shit we all actually are. How disrespectful we all actually are. A vaccine shot will not make you a responsible mature adult. But hallucination will. The more downvotes I get the more it just proves the point.;Annoyance
Can he participate via zoom? What a boneheaded move.;Joy
Bye bye Novac Yocovid;Annoyance

Vaxxed or not you still catch it and spread it. Don't see the point in forcing people to get something that doesn't work, sure it makes it less severe, but still doesn't stop the spread which seems to be what everyone focuses on lol;Anger
Lets call him jokeovic;Annoyance
Djokovic you fucking twat. This could all have been avoided.;Joy
The GOAT implications of this are huge. Djoker without Aussie tournament is almost as bad as Nadal without RG. Of course, Novax still has a great shot because he gets to play on his favorite court 2x per year, but the Australian Open is for sure his base.;Vitality

Why does this feel so good tho?;Joy
It's obviously the most just outcome.  What's sad is that the system didn't really work in this case, and the deportation came as a last resort by the sole elected executive.  It should never have come to that.;Joy
Nice lesson to all the famous arrogant guys;Joy
Laws should apply equally‚Ä¶whether you are a celebrity or commoner. Kudos to Australia. On the other hand, good luck with anything like this in the US.;Joy
