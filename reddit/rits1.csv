Body;Emotion
This has been such a back and forth story, if only there was some kind of sports metaphor to go with it.;Humour
Hope at least some of this has been captured on Nothing to Declare;Humour
"Two questions:
1) Is he removed from the hotel he's staying at and put back into a detention centre until being deported?
2) Will his 3 year ban from Australia for lying on immigration forms also apply to any of the other 5-eyes nations like it usually would?";Humour
First player to be out of a tournament after missing just two shots.;Humour
"if he gets 3-year re-entry ban, he'll be 38 by the time hes allowed to play in australia again, he'll probably be retired, which means hes 
already played his last game at Australian open";Humour
"I don’t see how Australia has any choice. They sternly insist that customs and immigration forms be accurate, or else consequences. If they say oh okay, unless your agent makes a human error, that’s fine. 
This was all in public, so there was really no way to quietly correct everything. 
The only downside is that I was hoping to someday sneak an overseas orange into 
Sydney by having my agent fill out NO on that question.";Awe
His Dad's response is going to be LIT;Humour
"Alex Hawke, the Immigration Minister used his authority to cancel Novak's visa.

If you can't be bothered clicking, here's his statement:
>""Today I exercised my power under section 133C(3) of the Migration Act to cancel the visa held by Mr Novak Djokovic on health and good order grounds, on the basis that it was in the public interest to do so.
>""This decision followed orders by the Federal Circuit and Family Court on 10 January 2022, quashing a prior cancellation decision on procedural fairness grounds.
>""In making this decision, I carefully considered information provided to me by the Department of Home Affairs, the Australian Border Force and Mr Djokovic.
>""The Morrison Government is firmly committed to protecting Australia's borders, particularly in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic.
>""I thank the officers of the Department of Home Affairs and the Australian Border Force who work every day to serve Australia's interests in increasingly challenging operational environments.”

He lied on his forms, and breached his visa doing so. No complaints here.";Vitality
Novisa Djokevict;Humour
Immigration Minister Hawke was just *so over this whole thing*.;Humour
They gave every opportunity to clarify/justify but his stupid ass and his parents did themselves no favors every step of the way.;Annoyance
Dumbest hills to die on.;Humour
"Hard for him to appeal getting canceled on ""health grounds"" when he obviously couldn't give a shit about covid";Annoyance
"Good luck appealing this in the Federal Court, it is almost unprecedented in Australia for a federal judge to order the executive 
government to grant someone a visa.";Awe
CONSEQUENCES? FOR MY ACTIONS?!;Humour
Every decision has a consequence. He chose his beliefs over career, he shouldn’t complain over the decision.;Awe
It’s good to see people that is put in pedestals being hold accountable. Sucks he’ll miss out the opportunity, but justice should be fair and equal.;Joy
"This person:
- Has lied in the documentation for his visa.
- In case his covid test from mid-december is real, he endangered a lot of people by breaking his isolation.
- In case his covid test is not real (most likely option), he's forged information to circumvent the restrictions imposed by a sovereign country to protect the health of its citizens.
This person should not only be deported from Australia for lying in the visa forms, he should be treated like every other person and be banned for the coming years.
Also, Serbian authorities should investigate if he really broke his isolation, and act accordingly.
On top of all of that, he's been spreading false information and false fears about the vaccines, and other things, for years, endangering a lot of people because of the influence he has.
No pity here.
Edit: thanks for the awards! Totally undeserved, I'm just saying what most people know and think.
Edit 2: I should add that if the test is real, he probably lied as well when entering Spain in Christmas. He should be investigated by Spanish authorities.";Annoyance
We faltered in the second set, but Australia has a great return Serb after all.;Humour
Some small part is sad I won't get to see him play getting boo'd and heckled by the crowd the entire time;Humour
"As someone from the UK, it's rather hilarious seeing the people who often cite Australia as a country that properly controls its borders and something to aspire to in that regard, 
now lose their shit because Australia are controlling their borders.";Annoyance
If he feels this is a negative situation and he sends positive energy and vibes towards it, he can overcome it right ?;Joy
"Glad it got cancelled. Exemption should only be given to those who are eligible. There are too many questionable information about Djokovic's case. 
You can't just blame ""human error"" on everything and expect the other side would accept it as an excuse.";Annoyance
"As a Kiwi…thank god our neighbours have some balls for this type of thing. Was worried if this type of situation leaked through it’d 
become precedent for us also.";Awe
Well done yah cunts;Humour
"Good, hopefully this leads to the start of ""celebrity's aren't exempt from the rules"" movement. Still a long way, but a step in the right direction.
And for those of you saying it's not his fault, it's his agents fault, too bad. Should of hired a more competent agent. Actions have consequences and nobody should be exempt from them.";Awe
i don't really care for tennis but i have already had enough Djokovic to last a lifetime.;Humour
"Mate he really fucked up everything , getting your visa cancelled by the Minister that's another level , I remember reaching Australia legally on a valid visa and then seeking asylum , 
it took me 6 years and 1 judicial apeal to be granted my permanent residency and I remember being in front of the judge telling me , I granted your visa because 
you proved to me and this country that you were a really good citizen , paying your taxes obeying and complying with Australian laws, many migrants can't
 stay here more than 1 year without committing an offense … Australian immigration system is tough but just be a good person pay your taxes and don't commit offences and you will be rewarded.";Awe
"> Mr Hawke said he cancelled the visa on ""health and good order grounds, on the basis that it was in the public interest to do so"".
I am glad to see the ""good order grounds"" in there too.";Humour
"Almost regardless of which of the many versions of ""facts"" presented by Djokovic one chooses to believe, he is clearly someone who does not respect the rules of Australia or 
Serbia with regard to Covid, and does not deserve favorable treatment.";Annoyance
"I don't care what your beliefs are about the vaccine, the only question that needs to be asked is how would a non-celebrity be treated. They would be deported. 
They probably would have never received an exemption in the first place.";Annoyance
Between this and Andrew being stripped of his titles, this is turning into a good week for justice being served on entitled assholes.;Humour
No surprise this is the decision, only thing surprising is how long it took.;Joy
A millionaire gets treated like a commoner? I need to rub my eyes.;Humour
Good. He shouldn’t get special privileges just because he is good at playing a sport.;Joy
"One of my patients is 89 and came to Australia after WWII. 

He STILL has his vaccination paperwork from England and the boosters he was required to get to enter the country. None of this is new. None of this is shocking. No jab, no entry.";Awe
Australia def. Djokovic 6-3 6-4 6-7 3-6 7-5;Humour
Love seeing rich entitled people punished like everyone else when deserved.;Uneasiness
"Vax or no vax, he attended an interview while he knew he was infected with covid AND removed his mask for a short time. That’s all they need to protect public interests.
Also I’ve seen border force. They don’t let you in if your eyebrows are a little uneven. How did he think he’d get away with this?";Annoyance
Announcing this on Serbian New Year. What a +1000 troll move;Humour
And in other news... Novak Djokovic is granted a wildcard entry, seeded #1 for next week's Manus Island Open.;Humour
The other players in the tournament, the fans, and the rest of Australia, all at once: ### Na nuh naa na. Na nuh naa na. Hey hey hey. Goodbye.;Humour
Took long enough but Hawke annoucing the decision right as the courts close for the weekend... golden XD.;Humour
Goodbye Novak! Hope this teaches him a lesson.;Humour
Dont let the door hit you on your way out you entitled ****;Humour
Fucked around...;Annoyance
Good riddance, blokes a shit cunt and should never have been allowed in;Humour
I wonder what countries will allow him to play tennis unvaxxed after this debacle.;Humour
Fuck all those Aussie Serb nationalist protestors gathering to support Doucehivich too.;Humour
"He Lied about his travel before arriving, he was unvaccinated, he Lied on his forms, Admitted to falsifying a covid test and Breached His Visa. 
He deserves it";Annoyance
First tennis player to be knocked out of a grand slam after missing only 2 shots.;Humour
I love Australia 💋;Humour
"Good. Send him back where he came from. The people in Australia have had one of the strictest lockdowns, and it’d be a slap in the face to them to 
allow this spoiled piece of crap to stay and play tennis.";Joy
"As an Australian, I am proud of our vaccination rates. He has had ample time and medical advice, to seek vaccination and has chosen not to do it. 
That's fine! His choice. However, to enter Australia, you must be vaccinated, or unable to get it medically. He lied about catching 
the virus and tried to flaunt an exemption in Australia's face. Well, Australia don't like tall poppies, so now he's received his first ""mowing incident"".";Annoyance
SEE YA, WANKER;Humour
Should be perma-banned from entering the country. Most people would be, for knowingly lying on their immigration forms.;Awe
That guy is a galactic level twat;Humour
No special treatment;Joy
Best news ever !!;Humour
Can't wait to see his family's tantrum;Suspense
Piss off you entitled fuck;Awe
Sports celebrity doesn't believe rules apply, breaks rules, fucks around, finds out.;Awe
Australia doesn't djoke around.;Humour
"Incredible how people will give up potentially millions of dollars because they refuse to take a vaccine with over 4 billion doses given out. 
Let alone lying on the entry forms.";Annoyance
Lol. Byeeee;Humour
Way to go Aussies.;Awe
Sends a great message to the masses that these rich entitled celebrity pricks cannot just do as they please.;Joy
"There has been a slight misunderstanding: 

Australia said: No one can come without vaccination.

Djokovic heard: No1 can come without vaccination.
Sucked in Djokovic! 

From a resident of Melbourne, we'll be glad to see you leave.";Humour
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.;Uneasiness
Good, anyone entering the country should follow the same rules, no exceptions.;Joy
Imminent shitstorm in Serbia, their God is in trouble. Holy Novax Jesus Djokovic.;Uneasiness
"Good. Same rules for everyone. Just because his over-inflated ego makes him feel he is above the law doesn't mean he actually is. 
His father is literally comparing him with Jesus while in the meantime he is lies on forms";Annoyance
Good, fuck him. Lying, sneaky arsehole;Uneasiness
Novak by name - no vac by nature;Humour
"Watching the courtroom live now. The current go seems to be he will be at hiss own own accommodations tonight, tomorrow morning he will have to report to be detained into border securities custody. 
Then he'll be released to consult with his lawyers and finally detained overnight again. There will be another hearing on sunday morning that will determine the final result of this kerfuckle. 
This is what the minister's lawyer has proposed, Novak's lawyers of course would like him to not be detained so he can freely consult with his lawyers.";Suspense
Turns out courts do work on weekends.;Humour
Novax Djokovic;Humour
Bye Felicia 👋;Humour
"The article said nothing about deporting him. I hope that actual physical deportment will be officially declared and carried out in the next couple days. 
He seriously needs a big public BOOT.";Awe
Good riddance, antivaxers gtfo;Humour
Good job, it shouldn’t have taken this long, I can’t go and see my mum in Victoria and he thinks he can come and play tennis after lying on his Visa card,good riddance;Sadness
"I’ve hated this man since 2009 when I went to the US Open and watched him beat Andy Roddick. Post match he made fun of Andy (forget if it was an injury or illness Andy had) and 
I always thought he was a huge piece of shit for doi g that and being a poor sport. And now I KNOW he’s a huge piece of shit. Seriously fuck this guy";Uneasiness
Serves him right. It’s his fault. The Aussie gov have all the aces here, so now he’s being booted out. Game set match.;Annoyance
I hope it was worth it chump, being antivax lost this guy $1 million for the most part...;Annoyance
One helluva saga;Humour
Stupid question, but is Novak his real first name?;Awe
He was granted exceptional visa. Until it was made political.;Annoyance

Hey!! Look at that, a glimmer of brightness in this world;Humour
Haha, what an idiot;Humour
Oh please this is entirely a political decision by the tyrannical Morrison govt to cover up failed covid policies;Awe
Woop Woop great news. I hope he isn't allowed into the UK this summer;Awe
He's richer than all of us here, so who cares;Uneasiness
He Lied about his travel before arriving, he was unvaccinated, he Lied on his forms, Admitted to falsifying a covid test and Breached His Visa. He deserves it;Uneasiness
I see a lot of envious comments.  Your fangs are showing!  🤣🤣🤣;Humour
Excellent decision, he lied and now he pays the consequences of his actions.;Awe
I'd say all world's governments should pay more attentions at people with covid related documents made in Serbia, clearly there are some issues.;Suspense
He was acting super shady and dishonest with the Aussie authorities. They did the right thing.;Awe
Best news ever !!;Joy
This is ridiculous. Serbia should recall their ambassadors to Australia and expel Australia’s ambassadors to them. Screw this Australian power trip;Uneasiness

Good. Being good at tennis doesn’t exempt you from the rules. Especially when you openly shit on the rules.;Joy
Nikola Jokavic is the best NBA center why would they deport him;Uneasiness

Do Nadal next.;Humour
"Don’t be too complimentary towards the Australian government over this. Although it may have been the right decision, make no mistake that this whole 
affair has been managed by the Morrison government to direct attention away from its inability to manage the domestic covid situation. It’s no coincidence 
that the decision was made just before the weekend to try and control the weekend media cycle.";Awe
If you are an Australian living in Serbia, be very very careful!!!!;Uneasiness

Never been to Australia, but in this whole situation they just come out as weak;Awe
Well I guess that the system sometimes works.;Humour
"My personal feeling is that Djokovic should never have been allowed into Australia. He had no legitimate reason not to be vaccinated, he lied 
on his visa application, and if not lying about his 2nd Covid diagnosis he deliberately exposed others to Covid by refusing to isolate. He frankly sounds like a scumbag.";Annoyance
But the Federal Circuit Court will have emergency hearing from 8:45pm tonight. Talking about special treatments......;Annoyance
