"Just because someone thinks it's normal to be an asshole doesn't mean they're not being an asshole. It just means they're not used to being held responsible for it.

Take a spoiled kid, for example. Just because their parents never punish them doesn't mean they're not a little asshole, right? Same thing here.";Joy
Australia did not stick to its rules... read about it. That's why a judge overturned the initial cancelation. Then a prime Minister overruled the judge. How would we react if a 3rd world country leader did this to a domestic judge? Or is ignorance of the rule of law ok if it's a western nation and when convenient? If you don't believe me, read it on the net.;Anger
"For all the bitter people celebrating this. Australian government have him a visa. It was valid. They let him get in the plane. Local border patrol canceled it. An Australian judge determined the cancelation was invalid and reinstated the visa  The immigration minister overruled the judge, and canceled the visa again.
I'm just curious what you law abiding citizens would say if a 3rd world leader overruled a court ruling because he/she wanted to? Even better, what would you say if trump overruled a court order, simply because he was president?";Anger
Someone doesn't lie Eastern Europeans... he is already the greatest and no matter how much they try to keep him down, he'll just keep winning. Can your racist ass deal with that?;Anger

"The minister exercises his executive power under s133 of the Migration Act. The legislature makes the law, the executive exercises powers under the law. 

The fact his power is exercised is not the issue. If it is exercised in the wrong way, it can be overturned. This is guaranteed by the judicial review portions of section 5 of the administrative decisions (judicial review act) 1977. 

And this is exactly the Act they have already sought to bring proceedings under, on the ground of irrationality. This is the issue that will be heard at the hearing on Sunday, referring to that specific act that you don‚Äôt think is a thing lol 

If the Minsters use of his EXECUTIVE power to cancel the visa is found to be improperly exercised under judicial review, the decision will be set aside by the court or quashed. 

This has been quite entertaining. 

Have a great evening.";Joy
"I live in Melbourne, officially the most locked down city in the world (google it) and here is how it is:

1. I can visit my friends and family whenever i want to.
2. Went to a bar last weekend and had a great time.
3. Just now went out for a walk. Weather was great.
4. I can get all the groceries and food i want whether go out shopping or have it delivered.
5. Only inconvenience is if im indoors in a public space then a mask is mandatory.
6. They recently banned dance floors in clubs and bars. Which is stupid IMO but as an Aussie who knows how the government makes its decisions I know its not based on political theatre but on scientific grounds and as such i comply. As do most of Australians (when i say most i dont mean 60% or 70% but 90%+. We support our governments and they support us back.)

He made the choices. He knew what the rules were. He shouldn't get special treatment because he is an athlete. I don't really blame Australia for canceling his visa.;Joy
"Is now a distraction from how they handled the pandemic initially, or a course correction? Not sure how good a ‚Äúbetter late than never‚Äù move does the government now, but I‚Äôm not in Australia so it‚Äôs difficult for me to gauge how the public overall is viewing this.

At least in terms of expediency in this situation, it looks like the court heard initial appeals late Friday and are having an open-to-the-public hearing Saturday morning. I do agree that making moves just ahead of a weekend is an asshole thing to do, regardless of the parties or disagreements involved. That‚Äôs a very very very favorite tactic of law enforcement here in the united states, and it‚Äôs equally odious-looking when happening elsewhere.

The furious debate that had engulfed Djokovic for the past 10 days ‚Äì whether a recent bout of COVID-19 provided him with a genuine exemption to travel to Australia without being vaccinated ‚Äì has been abandoned by the government without Mr Hawke even reading Djokovic‚Äôs extensive submissions on the question.""

I had to go to 5 different places just to find chicken because every supermarket is out of meat. And Toilet Paper. Hard to find some veges, too. 

We don't give a fuck about this Novak dickhead, we can't live our lives. This is drawn out with the explicit purpose of distracting the public from the failures of our current government. It's lucky that it's summer here and schools aren't in, but there's been little communication on what's going to happen when we go back to school, as the government hasn't purchased tests, so how are we supposed to ensure kids are safe?

The judge who overturned the initial decision expressed a willingness to hear the case again. There‚Äôs the possibility that the appeal process will be lengthy so a bridging visa may be issued, and there is a scenario where he plays under the bridging visa and ultimately loses the case.

It doesn't matter if he's blaming his agent, HE signed it, and signed it to say the above information was orrect, which was a lie.  ItIt's not a long form.

&gt;The part about him lying about covid is also not true, and once again, thats not the grounds on which he is being potentially deported.

Of course it is.  It's been found the test result was edited ten days after the document was created.  He claimed he was positive on a  PCR, but used a negative PCR test to travel two days later.  He claimed he was positive, but met people and travelled. The guy has spun a tangled web of lies and it's tumbled down around him..";Anger
Thank you. I will hold the cunt torch with pride.;Humour
He's already admitted to breaking quarantine *in Austrailia while positive* last month, so I think there's a valid concern that he would do it again. It's not like he plays tennis and then holes up in his hotel, and if that's what he was ordered to do there's a valid concern that he wouldn't comply anyway. At the end of the day, my biggest issue is with exceptions being made because he's a star tennis player. Either enforce the rules or don't, but this person in particular has demonstrated that they aren't worthy of an exception anyway.;Anger
Do ya like dragons?;Humour
"Well, I think its rational to not require vaccination for short term tourists as long as they are PCR negative on entry and have medical insurance to cover any hospitalisation. As they are in the country for a short term while mingling with mostly (80%) vaccinated population risk of them catching an infection and spreading it is minimal. 

For someone like Djokovic or other sports person, they generally live in bubbles and their health/status is constantly monitored, so I don't think this requirement is relevant.";Anger

Djokovic is also a human being and the government are no longer stating he has done anything wrong and yet are going to deport him anyway.;Anger

Have a Vegemite sandwich and get out. Lying fraud.;Joy
Now he gets to go through this each and every time he tries to enter a country with vax requirements. So long Wimbledon, US Open, and maybe French, not to mention the numerous ATP matches. Yeah, getting the vax would have made his dreams much more possible.;Anger
Good. The man is a cunt. I hope he plays out the rest of his career on various courts around the Balkans.;Joy

"Roger was 36 in 2018 when he won the AO
Also, the average age of champions of the AO is 25.8. (https://trove42.com/ages-grand-slam-champions-statistical-comparison-4-majors/)
 
It‚Äôs not impossible for novak to win at 37, but the probability is lower. 

Commenting on immigration, novak did get singled out. Other players in a similar situation were allowed into Australia, and only booted out once this circus began.";Nostalgia
DEPORTED!! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ;Joy
"Because this anti-vax, anti-lockdown, anti-covid-measures ideology stems from the right-wing, who spend the vast majority of the pandemic parroting Trump and Fox News talking points.

And it's still happening!

- The anti-vax Canadians clustered at the PPC

- Anti-vax Americans clustered around Trump

- Anti-vax Australians clustered around Pauline Hanson and the UAP

- Anti-vax Britons clustered around the Reform Party / Brexit Party.

It is NOT a coincidence that all these people are right-wing";Anger
There is so many comments here that are literally or almost the same in content, same phrases, same word order, I find it incredibly hard to believe that half of these aren't bots;Anger

I personally don't want to get vaccinated yet, as I don't feel that there was remotely enough time to test out all the possible side effects. BUT, I wear a mask, don't go to public gatherings, and don't engage in any risky behaviour, generally. I have nothing against people who have been vaccinated, but I feel my standpoint is reasonably valid. The existence of extremely antivax and conspiracy theorists just led to a separation between vax/no vax in society. The difference being that I'm only seeing vax people calling the other side scumbags.;Anger
Maybe Johnny Depp helped Jokervic with his declaration!;Annoyance

"Just kick Novak out of country NOW‚Ä¶.
1. Lies about covid
2. Lies about exemptions (what medical basis was he exempt? No 1 tennis athlete in world!) also, could we expose the expert medical panel who approved this for tennis Australia?
3. Lies about travelling around while he has covid
He is a self privileged, self entitled spoilt tennis player. Overpaid, and overstayed.
Deport him now, and sack tennis Australia CEO";Anger
I've never even been on a plane before, much less out of the country. These stories make it seem like more of a hassle than its worth honestly.;Annoyance
It's like a yo-yo competition in here;Humour
I‚Äôm not his biggest fan, but the guy is currently number 1 in the world and has been at the top of his sport for about 13 years. How is it possible you‚Äôve never heard of him?;Annoyance
Who? Oh right, just another person beholden to the laws of the country they find themselves in‚Ä¶;Anger
Waiting on the inevitable Netflix documentary lol;Humour
"Novak... No-Vak...*No Vac*...

Djokovic... Do-you-covi...

Life is too much. At least he's not named Slobodan Chlamydiaforall. It's cocktail hour somewhere. Possibly evidenced by the last few lines.";Annoyance
